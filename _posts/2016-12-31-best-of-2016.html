  <p>Looking back at Geometry Club this past year has made me immensely proud. Geometry Club has been highlighted by some of my favourite blogs in design/creativity; <a class="link-border" href="http://www.aisleone.net/2016/03/23/geometry-club/">Aisle One</a> and <a class="link-border" href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/03/geometry-club.html">Swiss Miss</a>. <a class="link-border" href="https://www.instagram.com/barbicancentre/">The Barbican Centre</a> got in on the act and did a mini-series of their own ‘Geometry Clubs’. Oh, and <a class="link-border" href="http://www.wearesweet.co/">Sweet</a> did a really cool piece on Snapchat about us which, i later learned, was the reason we got 3 or 4 thousand new followers in one day.</p>
  <p><b>I’ve got some exciting things in the pipeline for 2017.</b> (Including an iOS app to help you line-up that shot with perfection, but more about that later).</p>
  <p>Thank you to everyone who’s followed along so far and a <b>high-five</b> to those of you who have contributed to #geometryclub. I literally couldn’t do it with y’all.</p>
  <p>Here’s my personal favourite twelve shots of 2016. <b>Happy New Year!</b></p>
