<section class="container-s mx-auto mt-4 mb-4">
  <p>The Broad is a new contemporary art museum founded by philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad on Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles. The museum is designed by <a class="border-link" href="http://www.dsrny.com/">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a> in collaboration with <a class="link-border" href="http://www.gensler.com/">Gensler</a>.</p>
  <p>Since it’s opening in September 2015, <a class="link-border" href="http://www.thebroad.org/">The Broad Museum</a> has been the most photographed piece of architecture that i’ve received submissions for on Geometry Club. I can’t feature every submission of The Broad. But, as it’s such a charming building, here’s a little mini series that i’ll keep updating as the submissions roll in.</p>
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
