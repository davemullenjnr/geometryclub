<div class="mb-4">
  <p>Welbeck Street car park is one of London’s most iconic brutalist-era landmarks. The multi-storey building was designed by Michael Blampied & Partners and completed in 1970. With it’s geometric modular facade, made up of 100+ concrete diamond-shaped frames, this building is a must-see when in London. However, time is of the essence as <a class="link-border" href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/10/welbeck-street-car-park-brutalist-era-demolition-eric-parry-architects-news-london-uk/">Westminster Council recently approved the demolition of this architectural classic</a> to make way for a 10-storey hotel.</p>

  <p>Thanks to those who has submitted their shots of it so far (below). If you’re lucky enough to stand beneath it before it’s demolished, snap my favourite composition, <a class="link-border" href="/submit">submit</a>, and i’ll add them here, too.</p>
