  <p><b>What a year!</b></p>
  <p><b>Creative Review interviewed me</b> and wrote a wonderful <a class="link-border" href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/instagram-project-geometry-club-collates-perfectly-aligned-architectural-photos/">piece about the project</a>. The article made it all the way into their February 2017 issue. Other notable (printed) praise came at the kind hands of Surface Magazine, The Observer, and The Guardian.</p>
  <p><b>I redesigned <em>this</em> website</b>, with an emphasis on simplicity and ease-of-use. Particularly for those accessing it on mobile devices.</p>
  <p>Finally, to round the year off, (iOS developer) <a class="link-border" href="https://www.alexedge.co.uk/">Alexander Edge</a> and I released the <a class="link-border" href="https://geometryclub.org/app/"><b>Geometry Club iOS app</b></a> â€” A free iPhone and iPad camera application that helps you to align your architecture photos with precision.</p>
  <p>As always, thank you for supporting, contributing to, and sharing the project! Please take a look at my personal favourite Geometry Club photos from 2017. (below)</p>
  <p><b>All the best for the new year!</b></p>
