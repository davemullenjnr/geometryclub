  <p>A huge thanks to HoodieHut for printing a limited run of this tote bag design for me. I'm looking at getting a batch printed in the future to sell along side my prints when I get them finalised.</p>
  <p>For context, HoodieHut are a local garment printing company based in Sheffield who specialise in <a  class="link-border" href="https://www.hoodiehut.co.uk/ski-hoodies/">ski trip hoodies</a> and <a  class="link-border" href="https://www.hoodiehut.co.uk/leavers-hoodies/">leavers hoodies</a> for schools, colleges, and universities here in the UK.</p>
