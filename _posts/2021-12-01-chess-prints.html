  <p>I absolutely love chess but the <i>'traditional'</i> aesthetic has never been quite to my taste. I’ve been looking for an excuse to make something that’s a bit more elegant and minimal. So, I’ve started making this series of chess prints based on popular openings.</p>
  <p>Here’s a link to my <a class="link-border" href="https://davemullenjnr.etsy.com">Etsy shop</a> where i've started to list them for sale.</p>
